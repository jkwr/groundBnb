    description: "This magnificent, modern, fully staffed (chef and driver) private villa has some of the best ocean views on Phuket. Our 8 main bedrooms with king size beds have magnificent views, beautiful en-suite bathrooms with jacuzzis (7 out of 8), large flat screen TVs, and built in closets. The villa features an several salas, a movie room, a pool table, a fitness centre, a spa, and a commanding rooftop jacuzzi. Dining is by the 4th floor infinity pool.Ideal for up to 8 adult couples and 5 children. The space Property type: Villa Accommodates: 16 adults (8 couples) and 5 children. Additional charges apply for additional guests. Bedrooms: 8+2 Bathrooms: 11 Beds: 8 king, 1 queen, and 2 bunk beds (4 singles for children only) Check In: 15:00 (3 PM) Check Out: 12:00 (noon) Guest access INTRODUCTION Majestically located on a hill overlooking Bangtao and Surin beaches (the latter hidden by trees), Villa Amonteera has some of the best views on Phuket and exudes modern luxury and opulence at every turn. The architecture of Villa Amonteera makes the most of the outstanding views, which are hard to match even on Phuket. The 8 king size bed rooms are decorated in modern fashion with built in closets, 46-55 inch flat screen TVs with satellite TV and DVD players, airconditioning, balconies, and en-suite bathrooms with showers and jacuzzis (all but one). The Master Bedroom Suite consists of one of the king size rooms, located on the corner with large windows, and the room with a queen sized bed. The two spaces share a bathroom which has two showers rather than a shower and a jacuzzi. The 4th floor and roof terraces above provide the most magnificent views during the day and at night guests have told us that it feels as if you can touch the stars. As you watch the sun set over the sea, whether from the infinity pool, the jacuzzi, or lounging with a drink after dinner, don't be surprised to find yourself gazing aimlessly into the distance. There is no need for words as the full realization that you are in a tropical paradise hits you. FACILITIES OVERVIEW The villa has 1 800 square meters of living space with 10 bedrooms and 11 bathrooms. It is ideal for up to 8 couples and accommodates up to 16 adults and 5 children. There are plenty of spaces for socializing and private relaxation including our library, the dining area by the swimming pool, the pool table, several rooftop areas, a movie room, and our spa area. The rooms with king size beds all have magnificent ocean views and en-suite bathrooms. The Master Bedroom Suite shares its bathroom with the adjoining queen size bedroom and has 2 showers instead of separate shower and jacuzzi. HANDICAP ACCESS The villa has handicap access to all guest areas except for the 3 bedrooms 'between levels' (see below), the fitness centre, and the rooftop terraces. If you take the elevator to the fourth floor, you will be greeted by one of the best panoramic views on Phuket. Most guests choose this are for relaxing evenings with music and food overlooking the magnificent Phuket west coast as the sun sets and on into the night. On the absolute rooftop, on the 5th floor, sits the lone rooftop jacuzzi with its glass front offering the opportunity for a relaxing and possibly romantic moment with a view as commanding as any on Phuket. FLOOR BY FLOOR TOUR: 1. The ground floor houses our staff quarters, food and beverage stores, and the kitchen, which provides a variety of Thai, Western, and Indian menus. Just tell our chef which menu will suit your group best in advance and enjoy experiencing the variety of dishes served with your friends. Though we do sell cigars, please note that tobacco may not be smoked indoors and that any drugs apart from alcohol and tobacco are strictly prohibited on our premises. The ground floor is also where we kindly request that guests leave their shoes. Between the 1st and 2nd floors lies our fully equipped gym with strength training machines, a variety of tread mills, free weights, and other gym equipment. 2. The 2nd floor is where you can find the Kids' Room, one of the king size bedrooms with ocean view and en-suite bathroom with jacuzzi, our home theatre room with 11 plush movie seats and a 120-inch screen, the pool table, and the spa area. The pool table lies just down the hall from the movie room. If one steps outside from where we have our pool table, one reaches the spa area, which has massage cots both outside and inside and is serviced by professional spa therapists with advance bookings. For any guests staying in the Kids' Room (which does not have an en-suite bathroom), bathrooms are available by the stairs, in the king size bedroom, and in the spa area. Between the 2nd and 3rd floor, between the 4rd and 4th floors, and above the 4th floor are the three king size bedrooms without elevator access. These rooms all have jacuzzis designed for 2 people in the en-suite bathrooms. The room above the 4th floor is the one with a Buddha statue on the balcony outside the room often seen in pictures of Amonteera and beautifully framing the bedroom view. This top room also has a staircase leading from the balcony directly down to the infinity pool for the best pool access in the house. Especially for those of our guests who enjoy an early morning dip before the others wake up, this bedroom is simply magnificent. 3. On the 3rd floor is our library sala, 3 king size bedrooms with ocean views, and the Master Bedroom Suite, which is composed of the largest king size bedroom and an adjoining space with a queen size bed and small study area. The bathroom of the Master Bedroom Suite is the only one adjoining a king size bedroom without a jacuzzi; instead, it has 2 showers to accommodate more people sharing the same bathroom. 4. The 4th floor houses the main dining area, the infinity pool, and several social spaces. This is also where you will find the coffee machine. The 4th and 2nd floors are both equipped with speakers and the sound system can be managed with the mobile phone app Phonos. 5. On the roof above the 4th floor, accessible only by stairway, are several sun chairs, a shaded social area, and the incredibly commanding rooftop jacuzzi. This is also where you will be able to see our solar panels, which help us reduce the villa's carbon footprint. GENERAL NOTES Whilst guests are encouraged to use the air conditioning and to be as comfortable as possible, it is worth noting that Villa Amonteera is well ventilated, encouraging natural cross breezes, which are surprisingly refreshing, mainly due to the relatively high elevation of the villa in the green hills of Northwestern Phuket. Though the villa has nearly 100 square meters of solar panels that provide the bulk of the electricity and hot water for the villa, any additional energy used will not have been generated in an environmentally sound way. The elevation and the natural cross breezes makes the villa almost completely free of mosquitoes. This is worth noticing since many other villas in Thailand are plagued with mosquitoes especially during the summer season. NEARBY Some of Phuket's best nightlife, restaurants, and beaches, are just a few minutes from the villa. There are several fantastic restaurants and beach clubs by Surin Beach. Furthermore, you are only a few minutes from Bangtao/Layan beach, Phuket's finest. TRANSPORTATION The villa has one chauffeur and a Toyota fifteen-seater mini-bus (seating maximum 11 guests as per new Phuket regulations 2017) or a seven seat Toyota SUV at their disposal 08:00-17:00 daily (except for airport transfers, which are arranged separately). There are four indoor parking spaces and four outdoor spaces should you wish to rent your own vehicle or have friends over for a visit. Please note that only one vehicle is available at a time as guests or other staff than the driver may not drive the cars with guests in them according to local law.

If there is need for menu alterations, these must be approved by the chef and manager so as to make sure the food can be prepared well. The kitchen is small and equipped with gas stoves and sharp objects, wherefore it may be used by our kitchen staff only.

The 2nd floor is where you can find the Kids' Room, one of the king size bedrooms with ocean view and en-suite bathroom with jacuzzi, our home theatre room with 11 plush movie seats and a 120-inch screen, the pool table, and the spa area. The pool table lies just down the hall from the movie room. If one steps outside from where we have our pool table, one reaches the spa area, which has massage cots both outside and inside and is serviced by professional spa therapists with advance bookings. For any guests staying in the Kids' Room (which does not have an en-suite bathroom), bathrooms are available by the stairs, in the king size bedroom, and in the spa area. Between the 2nd and 3rd floor, between the 4rd and 4th floors, and above the 4th floor are the three king size bedrooms without elevator access. These rooms all have jacuzzis designed for 2 people in the en-suite bathrooms. The room above the 4th floor is the one with a Buddha statue on the balcony outside the room often seen in pictures of Amonteera and beautifully framing the bedroom view. This top room also has a staircase leading from the balcony directly down to the infinity pool for the best pool access in the house. Especially for those of our guests who enjoy an early morning dip before the others wake up, this bedroom is simply magnificent. 3. On the 3rd floor is our library sala, 3 king size bedrooms with ocean views, and the Master Bedroom Suite, which is composed of the largest king size bedroom and an adjoining space with a queen size bed and small study area. The bathroom of the Master Bedroom Suite is the only one adjoining a king size bedroom without a jacuzzi; instead, it has 2 showers to accommodate more people sharing the same bathroom. 4. The 4th floor houses the main dining area, the infinity pool, and several social spaces. This is also where you will find the coffee machine. The 4th and 2nd floors are both equipped with speakers and the sound system can be managed with the mobile phone app Phonos. 5. On the roof above the 4th floor, accessible only by stairway, are several sun chairs, a shaded social area, and the incredibly commanding rooftop jacuzzi. This is also where you will be able to see our solar panels, which help us reduce the villa's carbon footprint. GENERAL NOTES Whilst guests are encouraged to use the air conditioning and to be as comfortable as possible, it is worth noting that Villa Amonteera is well ventilated, encouraging natural cross breezes, which are surprisingly refreshing, mainly due to the relatively high elevation of the villa in the green hills of Northwestern Phuket. Though the villa has nearly 100 square meters of solar panels that provide the bulk of the electricity and hot water for the villa, any additional energy used will not have been generated in an environmentally sound way. The elevation and the natural cross breezes makes the villa almost completely free of mosquitoes. This is worth noticing since many other villas in Thailand are plagued with mosquitoes especially during the summer season. NEARBY Some of Phuket's best nightlife, restaurants, and beaches, are just a few minutes from the villa. There are several fantastic restaurants and beach clubs by Surin Beach. Furthermore, you are only a few minutes from Bangtao/Layan beach, Phuket's finest. TRANSPORTATION The villa has one chauffeur and a Toyota fifteen-seater mini-bus (seating maximum 11 guests as per new Phuket regulations 2017) or a seven seat Toyota SUV at their disposal 08:00-17:00 daily (except for airport transfers, which are arranged separately). There are four indoor parking spaces and four outdoor spaces should you wish to rent your own vehicle or have friends over for a visit.

Bedrooms: 8+2 Bathrooms: 11 Beds: 8 king, 1 queen, and 2 bunk beds (4 singles for children only) Check In: 15:00 (3 PM) Check Out: 12:00 (noon) Guest access INTRODUCTION Majestically located on a hill overlooking Bangtao and Surin beaches (the latter hidden by trees), Villa Amonteera has some of the best views on Phuket and exudes modern luxury and opulence at every turn. The architecture of Villa Amonteera makes the most of the outstanding views, which are hard to match even on Phuket. The 8 king size bed rooms are decorated in modern fashion with built in closets, 46-55 inch flat screen TVs with satellite TV and DVD players, airconditioning, balconies, and en-suite bathrooms with showers and jacuzzis (all but one). The Master Bedroom Suite consists of one of the king size rooms, located on the corner with large windows, and the room with a queen sized bed. The two spaces share a bathroom which has two showers rather than a shower and a jacuzzi. The 4th floor and roof terraces above provide the most magnificent views during the day and at night guests have told us that it feels as if you can touch the stars. As you watch the sun set over the sea, whether from the infinity pool, the jacuzzi, or lounging with a drink after dinner, don't be surprised to find yourself gazing aimlessly into the distance. There is no need for words as the full realization that you are in a tropical paradise hits you. FACILITIES OVERVIEW The villa has 1 800 square meters of living space with 10 bedrooms and 11 bathrooms. It is ideal for up to 8 couples and accommodates up to 16 adults and 5 children. There are plenty of spaces for socializing and private relaxation including our library, the dining area by the swimming pool, the pool table, several rooftop areas, a movie room, and our spa area. The rooms with king size beds all have magnificent ocean views and en-suite bathrooms. The Master Bedroom Suite shares its bathroom with the adjoining queen size bedroom and has 2 showers instead of separate shower and jacuzzi. HANDICAP ACCESS The villa has handicap access to all guest areas except for the 3 bedrooms 'between levels' (see below), the fitness centre, and the rooftop terraces. If you take the elevator to the fourth floor, you will be greeted by one of the best panoramic views on Phuket. Most guests choose this are for relaxing evenings with music and food overlooking the magnificent Phuket west coast as the sun sets and on into the night. On the absolute rooftop, on the 5th floor, sits the lone rooftop jacuzzi with its glass front offering the opportunity for a relaxing and possibly romantic moment with a view as commanding as any on Phuket. FLOOR BY FLOOR TOUR: 1. The ground floor houses our staff quarters, food and beverage stores, and the kitchen, which provides a variety of Thai, Western, and Indian menus. Just tell our chef which menu will suit your group best in advance and enjoy experiencing the variety of dishes served with your friends. Though we do sell cigars, please note that tobacco may not be smoked indoors and that any drugs apart from alcohol and tobacco are strictly prohibited on our premises. The ground floor is also where we kindly request that guests leave their shoes.

It may be possible to arrange an early check-in or late check-out, of which we’d be happy to try and accommodate you, but since we may have other guests leaving or arriving on the same day, it is not always possible. The early check-in or late checkout fee (if possible) is US$350.

    description: "This magnificent, modern, fully staffed (chef and driver) private villa has some of the best ocean views on Phuket. Our 8 main bedrooms with king size beds have magnificent views, beautiful en-suite bathrooms with jacuzzis (7 out of 8), large flat screen TVs, and built in closets. The villa features an several salas, a movie room, a pool table, a fitness centre, a spa, and a commanding rooftop jacuzzi. Dining is by the 4th floor infinity pool.Ideal for up to 8 adult couples and 5 children. The space Property type: Villa Accommodates: 16 adults (8 couples) and 5 children. Additional charges apply for additional guests. Bedrooms: 8+2 Bathrooms: 11 Beds: 8 king, 1 queen, and 2 bunk beds (4 singles for children only) Check In: 15:00 (3 PM) Check Out: 12:00 (noon) Guest access INTRODUCTION Majestically located on a hill overlooking Bangtao and Surin beaches (the latter hidden by trees), Villa Amonteera has some of the best views on Phuket and exudes modern luxury and opulence at every turn. The architecture of Villa Amonteera makes the most of the outstanding views, which are hard to match even on Phuket. The 8 king size bed rooms are decorated in modern fashion with built in closets, 46-55 inch flat screen TVs with satellite TV and DVD players, airconditioning, balconies, and en-suite bathrooms with showers and jacuzzis (all but one). The Master Bedroom Suite consists of one of the king size rooms, located on the corner with large windows, and the room with a queen sized bed. The two spaces share a bathroom which has two showers rather than a shower and a jacuzzi. The 4th floor and roof terraces above provide the most magnificent views during the day and at night guests have told us that it feels as if you can touch the stars. As you watch the sun set over the sea, whether from the infinity pool, the jacuzzi, or lounging with a drink after dinner, don't be surprised to find yourself gazing aimlessly into the distance. There is no need for words as the full realization that you are in a tropical paradise hits you. FACILITIES OVERVIEW The villa has 1 800 square meters of living space with 10 bedrooms and 11 bathrooms. It is ideal for up to 8 couples and accommodates up to 16 adults and 5 children. There are plenty of spaces for socializing and private relaxation including our library, the dining area by the swimming pool, the pool table, several rooftop areas, a movie room, and our spa area. The rooms with king size beds all have magnificent ocean views and en-suite bathrooms. The Master Bedroom Suite shares its bathroom with the adjoining queen size bedroom and has 2 showers instead of separate shower and jacuzzi. HANDICAP ACCESS The villa has handicap access to all guest areas except for the 3 bedrooms 'between levels' (see below), the fitness centre, and the rooftop terraces. If you take the elevator to the fourth floor, you will be greeted by one of the best panoramic views on Phuket. Most guests choose this are for relaxing evenings with music and food overlooking the magnificent Phuket west coast as the sun sets and on into the night. On the absolute rooftop, on the 5th floor, sits the lone rooftop jacuzzi with its glass front offering the opportunity for a relaxing and possibly romantic moment with a view as commanding as any on Phuket. FLOOR BY FLOOR TOUR: 1. The ground floor houses our staff quarters, food and beverage stores, and the kitchen, which provides a variety of Thai, Western, and Indian menus. Just tell our chef which menu will suit your group best in advance and enjoy experiencing the variety of dishes served with your friends. Though we do sell cigars, please note that tobacco may not be smoked indoors and that any drugs apart from alcohol and tobacco are strictly prohibited on our premises. The ground floor is also where we kindly request that guests leave their shoes. Between the 1st and 2nd floors lies our fully equipped gym with strength training machines, a variety of tread mills, free weights, and other gym equipment. 2. The 2nd floor is where you can find the Kids' Room, one of the king size bedrooms with ocean view and en-suite bathroom with jacuzzi, our home theatre room with 11 plush movie seats and a 120-inch screen, the pool table, and the spa area. The pool table lies just down the hall from the movie room. If one steps outside from where we have our pool table, one reaches the spa area, which has massage cots both outside and inside and is serviced by professional spa therapists with advance bookings. For any guests staying in the Kids' Room (which does not have an en-suite bathroom), bathrooms are available by the stairs, in the king size bedroom, and in the spa area. Between the 2nd and 3rd floor, between the 4rd and 4th floors, and above the 4th floor are the three king size bedrooms without elevator access. These rooms all have jacuzzis designed for 2 people in the en-suite bathrooms. The room above the 4th floor is the one with a Buddha statue on the balcony outside the room often seen in pictures of Amonteera and beautifully framing the bedroom view. This top room also has a staircase leading from the balcony directly down to the infinity pool for the best pool access in the house. Especially for those of our guests who enjoy an early morning dip before the others wake up, this bedroom is simply magnificent. 3. On the 3rd floor is our library sala, 3 king size bedrooms with ocean views, and the Master Bedroom Suite, which is composed of the largest king size bedroom and an adjoining space with a queen size bed and small study area. The bathroom of the Master Bedroom Suite is the only one adjoining a king size bedroom without a jacuzzi; instead, it has 2 showers to accommodate more people sharing the same bathroom. 4. The 4th floor houses the main dining area, the infinity pool, and several social spaces. This is also where you will find the coffee machine. The 4th and 2nd floors are both equipped with speakers and the sound system can be managed with the mobile phone app Phonos. 5. On the roof above the 4th floor, accessible only by stairway, are several sun chairs, a shaded social area, and the incredibly commanding rooftop jacuzzi. This is also where you will be able to see our solar panels, which help us reduce the villa's carbon footprint. GENERAL NOTES Whilst guests are encouraged to use the air conditioning and to be as comfortable as possible, it is worth noting that Villa Amonteera is well ventilated, encouraging natural cross breezes, which are surprisingly refreshing, mainly due to the relatively high elevation of the villa in the green hills of Northwestern Phuket. Though the villa has nearly 100 square meters of solar panels that provide the bulk of the electricity and hot water for the villa, any additional energy used will not have been generated in an environmentally sound way. The elevation and the natural cross breezes makes the villa almost completely free of mosquitoes. This is worth noticing since many other villas in Thailand are plagued with mosquitoes especially during the summer season. NEARBY Some of Phuket's best nightlife, restaurants, and beaches, are just a few minutes from the villa. There are several fantastic restaurants and beach clubs by Surin Beach. Furthermore, you are only a few minutes from Bangtao/Layan beach, Phuket's finest. TRANSPORTATION The villa has one chauffeur and a Toyota fifteen-seater mini-bus (seating maximum 11 guests as per new Phuket regulations 2017) or a seven seat Toyota SUV at their disposal 08:00-17:00 daily (except for airport transfers, which are arranged separately). There are four indoor parking spaces and four outdoor spaces should you wish to rent your own vehicle or have friends over for a visit. Please note that only one vehicle is available at a time as guests or other staff than the driver may not drive the cars with guests in them according to local law.

For all meals, guests choose one of our varied set menus per meal (menus are themed and feature several regional types of Thai cuisine, Western food, Indian food, BBQ, and our exclusive Andaman Sea Harvest). We greatly appreciate that a single multiple choice choice menu is selected for the entire group so as to optimize food quality and timeliness. If there is need for menu alterations, these must be approved by the chef and manager so as to make sure the food can be prepared well. The kitchen is small and equipped with gas stoves and sharp objects, wherefore it may be used by our kitchen staff only. The 4th floor dining area has a table seating 16 people and the adjacent bar can seat another 8 people. At the short end of the pool, there is another dining table for 6-8 people. On the next level (level 5, the roof) offers open-air dining and can accommodate up to 16 people at the dining table (not including the seats in the three Salas). *** Villa Amonteera offers full service for weddings, private parties and other events for 50+ people.
